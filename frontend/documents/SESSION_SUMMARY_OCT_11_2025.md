## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Consistent Patterns**: Copying successful patterns accelerated development
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript caught errors before runtime
3. **Syncfusion Components**: Pre-built UI components saved hours
4. **Signal-based State**: Reactive patterns simplified data flow
5. **Pragmatic Approach**: Working features beat perfect features

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Date Formatting**: Backend expects DateOnly, frontend uses Date objects
2. **Grid Styling**: Had to force white backgrounds for readability
3. **Form Validation**: Required proper DTO typing for API calls
4. **Chart Data**: Needed computed signals for reactive chart updates

### Best Practices Established
1. **Always use signals for state**
2. **Always use Observables for API calls**
3. **Always provide user feedback via toasts**
4. **Always include loading states**
5. **Always style grids with white backgrounds**
6. **Always validate forms before submission**
