3. **Missing DataService methods** - Add all entity types
4. **Form validation** - Better error handling

### Week 3-4: User Experience
1. **Loading states** - Spinners and skeletons
2. **Empty states** - Helpful messages and CTAs
3. **Grid enhancements** - Toolbar, export, column chooser
4. **Calendar views** - Bills and maintenance scheduling

### Week 5-6: Intelligence
1. **Smart notifications** - Due date reminders
2. **Automation** - Recurring bills and tasks
3. **Basic reports** - Monthly summaries
4. **Search** - Global search functionality

### Week 7-8: Polish
1. **Accessibility** - WCAG compliance
2. **Mobile optimization** - PWA setup

2. **Documentation**
3. **Deployment setup**
4. **Beta testing**

## Technical Debt to Address

### Current Limitations
1. **No real data persistence** - Data lost on refresh
2. **No edit/delete** - Can only add, not modify
3. **Mock data only** - No real user data
4. **No authentication** - Anyone can access
5. **Limited error handling** - Happy path only
6. **No offline support** - Requires internet
7. **No data export** - Can't backup data
8. **Basic validation** - Needs improvement

### Code Improvements Needed
1. **Service layer** - Separate business logic
2. **State management** - Consider NgRx or Signals Store
3. **Error boundaries** - Global error handling
4. **Logging** - Structured logging
5. **Type safety** - More strict types
6. **Code coverage** - Comprehensive tests
