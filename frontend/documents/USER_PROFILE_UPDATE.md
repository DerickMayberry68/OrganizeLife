# User Profile Display Update âœ…

## What Was Changed

I've updated the **Header** and **Sidebar** components to display the logged-in user's name dynamically.

### Files Modified:

1. **`header.component.ts`**
   - Injected `AuthService`
   - Added `currentUser` getter
   - Added `userDisplayName` getter (extracts name from email)
   - Added `logout()` method

2. **`header.component.html`**
   - Replaced hardcoded "Adam Schwartz" with `{{ userDisplayName }}`
   - Added user email to dropdown header
   - Updated dropdown menu with better icons
   - Changed "Log Out" link to call `logout()` method

3. **`sidebar.component.ts`**
   - Injected `AuthService`
   - Added `currentUser` getter
   - Added `userDisplayName` getter
   - Added `userRole` getter (shows Admin, Member, etc.)
   - Added `logout()` method

4. **`sidebar.component.html`**
   - Replaced hardcoded "Sean Ngu" with `{{ userDisplayName }}`
   - Replaced hardcoded "Front end developer" with `{{ userRole }}`
   - Updated profile menu with better icons
   - Changed "Helps" to "Log Out" with logout functionality

## Features Added

### Header (Top Right)
âœ… **User Dropdown**
- Displays user's name (extracted from email)
- Shows full email in dropdown header
- Edit Profile link
- Settings link
- **Log Out button** (red, with icon)

### Sidebar (Left Panel)
âœ… **Profile Section**
- Displays user's name
- Shows user's role (Admin, Member, etc.)
- Expandable profile menu with:
  - Edit Profile
  - Settings
  - **Log Out button** (red, with icon)

## How It Works

### User Display Name
The system extracts the user's name from their email:
- `derickmayberry@gmail.com` â†’ **"Derickmayberry"**
- `john.doe@example.com` â†’ **"John Doe"**

If no email is available, it defaults to "User".

### User Role
The role comes from the user's household membership:
- "Admin" - Household administrator
- "Member" - Regular household member

### Logout Functionality
Clicking "Log Out" in either location will:
1. Clear all authentication tokens
2. Clear user data from localStorage
3. Redirect to `/login` page

## Testing

1. **Start the Angular App**:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\deric\source\repos\StudioXConsulting\Projects\TheButler
   ng serve
   ```

2. **Login**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/login`
   - Login with your credentials

3. **Check Header**:
   - Look at the top-right corner
   - Click on your name to see the dropdown
   - Your email should be visible

4. **Check Sidebar**:
   - Look at the left sidebar profile section
   - You should see your name and role
   - Click to expand the profile menu

5. **Test Logout**:
   - Click "Log Out" from either location
   - You should be redirected to the login page
   - Try accessing `/dashboard` - you should be sent back to login

## Future Enhancements (Photos)

When you're ready to add profile photos, you can:

1. Store photo URL in user metadata
2. Update `AuthService` to include `avatarUrl` in `CurrentUser` interface
3. Replace the `<i class="fa fa-user"></i>` icon with:
   ```html
   <img [src]="currentUser?.avatarUrl || 'assets/default-avatar.png'" alt="User" />
   ```

## Notes

- User data is reactive - if the user info changes, the display will automatically update
- The name extraction is smart and capitalizes each word
- Both header and sidebar use the same service, so they're always in sync
- Logout clears everything and ensures security

**All set!** ðŸŽ‰ Your header and sidebar now show the logged-in user's information!
