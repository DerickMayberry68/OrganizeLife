## 📸 About Screenshots

**I cannot capture screenshots directly** because I'm an AI and don't have access to:
- Your running application
- Screenshot tools
- Image capture capabilities

**But you can easily capture them!** The `screenshots/README.md` file provides:
- Step-by-step instructions for Windows, Mac, and Linux
- Browser developer tools method
- Recommended dimensions and formats
- Image optimization tips
- Privacy and security guidelines

**It's actually better this way** because:
1. You control what data is shown
2. You can ensure everything looks perfect
3. You can capture with real data or test data
4. You can update them easily as your app evolves
